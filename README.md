# Simple Cafe Management System

## Overview

The Simple Cafe Management System is a C program that provides functionality for managing a cafe's menu and customer orders. The program is designed to be run in the command line and offers separate menus for administrators and customers.

- **Admin Menu**: Administrators can perform actions like viewing the menu, adding items to the menu, deleting items from the menu, and calculating the total sales.

- **Customer Menu**: Customers can order items from the menu, view their orders, delete items from their orders, and calculate their total bill.

The code is structured using a linked list to manage the menu items and customer orders efficiently. It serves as a simple example of a text-based cafe management system.
